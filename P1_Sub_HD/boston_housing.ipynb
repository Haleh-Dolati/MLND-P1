    "## Getting Started\n",
    "In this project, you will evaluate the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. A model trained on this data that is seen as a *good fit* could then be used to make certain predictions about a home — in particular, its monetary value. This model would prove to be invaluable for someone like a real estate agent who could make use of such information on a daily basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing). The Boston housing data was collected in 1978 and each of the 506 entries represent aggregated data about 14 features for homes from various suburbs in Boston, Massachusetts. For the purposes of this project, the following preprocessing steps have been made to the dataset:\n",
    "- 16 data points have an `'MEDV'` value of 50.0. These data points likely contain **missing or censored values** and have been removed.\n",
    "- 1 data point has an `'RM'` value of 8.78. This data point can be considered an **outlier** and has been removed.\n",
    "- The features `'RM'`, `'LSTAT'`, `'PTRATIO'`, and `'MEDV'` are essential. The remaining **non-relevant features** have been excluded.\n",
    "- The feature `'MEDV'` has been **multiplicatively scaled** to account for 35 years of market inflation.\n",

However, it seems at 300 the decline is very small and score remains around 0.8. <br>\n",

By increasing the number of training points, the scores goes up since now the model in generalized and can represent the population better.

    "### Question 5 - Bias-Variance Tradeoff\n",
    "* When the model is trained with a maximum depth of 1, does the model suffer from high bias or from high variance? \n",
    "* How about when the model is trained with a maximum depth of 10? What visual cues in the graph justify your conclusions?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** High bias is a sign of underfitting(model is not complex enough to pick up the nuances in the data) and high variance is a sign of overfitting(model is by-hearting the data and cannot generalize well). Think about which model(depth 1 or 10) aligns with which part of the tradeoff."

    "**Answer: **<br>\n",
    "This graph shows how increasing the maximum depth affects the performance of a model on training and test data. At the beginning, with the maximum depth of 1, we have a model that underfits. Although the training and test scores are close (around 0.4), both of them are really low. This happens because the model has high bias and is not complex enough to capture all aspect of the data. <br>\n",
    "By increasing the maximum complexity, we can see the score for training data is constantly improving. However, the score for testing data increases rapidly at first and the declines. Therefore when the maximum depth reaches number 10, the score for training data is higher than ever but the testing data score is less than other smaller depths (max depth of 4, for example). So as the graph shows, at the maximum depth 10 there is a huge gap between training and testing data scores and the variance for testing data is really large. This is a sign of overfitting, which means the model is not generalized enough for the population"

Different values for these parameters could change the behavior of the algorithm hence result in different model. Grid search tried different combination of the specified values for parameters to find out the best combination. This is called tuning. For example, we want to see which maximum depth would give us the best score. We can use the grid search and try maximum depth 1 to 10 and choose the best."

    "Dividing our data to training and test helps us to test our model and its performance with an unseen set of data. While this can help us to see how our model is doing, it gives us some some limitations. For example we can test our model only once! Instead, we can divide our training data to K equal bins and each time use k-1 of them for training and 1 for validating. We repeat this process K times so each bean is used one and only 1 time for validating and K-1 times for training. At the end, by taking the average of the scores of the validations we will get a single realistic validation score. These splits are called folds and K-folds mean we slit the data into K bins. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "We then iterate through the k chunks one by one and use the current chunk for model validation and the remaining k-1 chunks for training. What we end up with are k trained and evaluated models and we have used the entire dataset for validation. Averaging the validation scores gives us a single validation score. It is more reliable than if we had used only one split. When a K-fold cross validation is combined with Grid Search, we can choose a model and its tuned parameters that perform the highest. It means we can find the best parameters for the model because there is less variance in performance estimate. \n",
    "Also in grid search because we are use the training-validation split so many times to different parameters combination, we may overfit the model. This happens because we try different combination and it might by chance find a point that gives us a really good performance. With K-Fold, since we are taking the average of K performances, this effect is minimized. \n",

    "Your final implementation requires that you bring everything together and train a model using the **decision tree algorithm**. To ensure that you are producing an optimized model, you will train the model using the grid search technique to optimize the `'max_depth'` parameter for the decision tree. The `'max_depth'` parameter can be thought of as how many questions the decision tree algorithm is allowed to ask about the data before making a prediction. Decision trees are part of a class of algorithms called *supervised learning algorithms*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, you will find your implementation is using `ShuffleSplit()` for an alternative form of cross-validation (see the `'cv_sets'` variable). While it is not the K-Fold cross-validation technique you describe in **Question 8**, this type of cross-validation technique is just as useful!. The `ShuffleSplit()` implementation below will create 10 (`'n_splits'`) shuffled sets, and for each shuffle, 20% (`'test_size'`) of the data will be used as the *validation set*. While you're working on your implementation, think about the contrasts and similarities it has to the K-fold cross-validation technique.\n",

    "This model, as is, cannot be trusted and be used in a real-world setting today. Although it has been adjusted for the inflation, that is not the only reason that can affect the price of a house today compared to 40 years ago. People’s perception of a neighborhood, change in lifestyle, gentrification, or change in education system, all can affect the price and cannot be captured by those 3 variables (number of bedrooms, Poverty in neighborhood, and student/teacher ratio). However, there are ways to improve the results:<br>\n",
    "1-\tCollecting more data for the past 40 years and add it to the dataset.<br>\n",
    "2-\tUsing more features such as:<br>\n",
    "- Square footage of the house<br>\n",
    "- Yard size<br>\n",
    "- Accessibility to public transit (walking distance, type of PT)<br>\n",
    "- Proximity to major employment centers<br>\n",
    "- Crime rate in the neighborhood<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Also it worth to mention this model cannot be used for other cities. The buyers and sellers behavior and preferences are totally different on Columbus (Ohio), Palo Alto (California), and Dallas (Texas). So this model cannot be used in other cities or rural areas. In addition, because this model was built based few variables, it may give us not so accurate estimate even for houses in the same neighborhood.<br>\n",
    "Another problem is the sensitivity analysis shows this model is not well generalized.  The minimum and maximum of the predicted price for the same client when we run the model 10 times, has almost 70,000 dollar difference. \n",
